            <h3>Why Bikes Are the Optimal Form of Campus Transport</h3>

            <p>Bikes are clearly the best way to get around college campuses. There are many reasons for this. For starters, it's the most convenient. If you want to take a bus somewhere, you have to find a stop nearby, and find a route, and hope there's a bus coming soon, and it's all just a really big hassle. Even if you have a car, you have to find somewhere to park all the time, and most of the time you have to pay for that parking. With a bike, you don't have to worry about any of that. You can go wherever you want, whenever you want, and you can just park at any one of the fifty bike racks outside every building. The second reason is that it can be really fun. Going really fast is great in general, but it's even better when you're able to feel it on your hair. Plus, there's nothing like the thrills of leaning into a slick turn. So there you have it, bikes are obviously the best way to move around campus. Of course, all of this goes out the window as soon as it starts raining, and biking immediately becomes the worst form of transport imaginable.</p>

            <h3>The History of FPS Games</h3>

            <p><img src="doom.webp" alt="The cover image for Doom (1993)."></p>
            <p>The first person shooter genre has a long and complex history. The earliest first-person shooter games, such as MIDI Maze, had 2D viewpoints and completely flat grounds. Wolfenstein 3D had these elements, as well as raycasting and simulated 3D. This game was incredibly popular, but it dwarfed in comparison to id Software's next title: Doom. This game took the Wolfenstein engine and improved heavily on it, adding variable height in the maps, animated textures, more complex enemy AI, and multiplayer deathmatches. Doom became the most installed piece of software of all time in 1993, and is still popular today. id later innovated again with Quake, which finally made the jump to full 3D, and was designed around multiplayer. Valve Software later took the Quake engine and modified it into the GoldSrc engine, with which they created Half-Life. This game pioneered the use of complex storytelling, allied NPCs, and more advance environmental interaction, making for a much more atmospheric experience. Half-Life ended up having a very large modding community, out of which sprang Counter-Strike and Team Fortress, each becoming some of the most popular multiplayer FPS games of all time. Later, on the Xbox, the release of Halo helped bring this online multiplayer to the console market with Xbox Live.</p>
